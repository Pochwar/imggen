#V2 is online
http://pochworld.com/imggen/v2

ImgGen V2 is an interactive version of V1 where users can generate images by changing parameters and see modifications in live !
Check the project here : http://pochworld.com/imggen/v2

I don't have much time to continue this project for now, but I have ideas to improve it :
- Add image models (for now only one model from the V1 is active : grid)
- Add fillmodes (spiral, target, ...)
- Ability to add elements (squares, rounds, ...) on differents layers
- Get a cleaner code ! (I'm not the best developper I know ;) )

If you're interessted by this project and want to help me, send me a mail !

Otherwise, have fun generating images !
